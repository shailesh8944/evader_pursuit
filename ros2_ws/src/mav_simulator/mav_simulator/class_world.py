File: class_world.py
Description: This file defines the World class which serves as the simulation environment
             container for the MAV simulator. The World class:
             
             - Manages multiple vessel instances within a unified simulation environment
             - Handles initialization of the simulation world from configuration files
             - Coordinates the simulation time stepping across all vessels
             - Provides ROS2 integration for distributed simulation
             - Maintains global simulation parameters like GPS datum and world boundaries
             - Orchestrates the overall simulation execution
             
             The World class acts as the top-level controller for the entire simulation,
             bringing together vessels, environmental conditions, and simulation parameters.
