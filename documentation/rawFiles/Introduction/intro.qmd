# Introduction

## About MAV Simulator

MAV Simulator (Marine Autonomous Vehicle Simulator) is a Python-based simulation framework designed for testing and developing control algorithms, sensors, and navigation systems for marine autonomous vehicles. The simulator provides a realistic environment for simulating various types of marine vessels in different sea conditions.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Advanced hydrodynamic modeling based on vessel hull forms
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy integration of custom vessel models, sensors, and controllers
- **ROS2 Integration**: Native support for Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) for distributed robotics applications
- **Configurable Environments**: Simulate different sea states, current patterns, and environmental conditions
- **Visualization Tools**: Built-in plotting capabilities for analyzing simulation results

## System Architecture

The simulator consists of several interconnected modules:

## Getting Started

To use the MAV Simulator, you need to:

1. Install the required dependencies
2. Configure vessel parameters
3. Set up environment conditions
4. Run simulations with or without ROS2 integration

The following sections provide detailed information about each component of the simulator and how to utilize them for your specific marine autonomous vehicle simulation needs.
