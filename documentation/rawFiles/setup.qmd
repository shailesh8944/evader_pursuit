# Setup {.unnumbered}

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- Docker installed on your system
- Basic understanding of terminal commands
- Python version 3.10 or higher

## Cloning the Repository

1. Open a terminal window
2. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarineAutonomy/makara.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd makara
   ```
4. Switch to the mavymini branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout mavymini
   ```

## Building the Docker Image

Before running the simulator, you need to build the Docker image:

1. Ensure you're in the root directory of the cloned repository
2. Build the Docker image by executing:
   ```bash
   ./ros2_devdocker.sh
   ```
3. Wait for the build process to complete (this may take several minutes depending on your internet connection and system performance)

## Running the Simulator (Quickstart)

After building the Docker image, you can start the simulator:

1. From the root directory of the repository, run:
   ```bash
   ./ros2_simulator.sh
   ```
2. The simulator will start and the ROS2 topics will be printed in the terminal

3. To view topic data, open a new terminal and run:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it panisim bash
   ```
4. Subscribe to a topic using:
   ```bash
   ros2 topic echo <topic_name>
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   ros2 topic echo /mavymini_00/odometry_sim
   ```


## Troubleshooting

- **Docker issues**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system
- **Permission issues**: If you encounter permission errors when running scripts, try prefixing the commands with `sudo`
