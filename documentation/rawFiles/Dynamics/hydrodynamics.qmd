## Overview

The Hydrodynamics module provides hydrodynamic models and calculations for marine vessels, including:

- Added mass and inertia
- Coriolis and centripetal forces
- Damping forces
- Restoring forces
- Wave and current effects

## Features

- Hydrodynamic coefficient calculations
- Force and moment computations
- Environmental force modeling
- State-dependent force calculations
- Integration with vessel dynamics

## Usage Example

```python
from mav_simulator.class_hydro import Hydrodynamics

# Create hydrodynamics instance
hydro = Hydrodynamics(hydro_data)

# Calculate forces and moments
forces, moments = hydro.calculate_forces(
    velocity=[u, v, w],
    angular_velocity=[p, q, r],
    position=[x, y, z],
    orientation=[phi, theta, psi]
)

# Apply forces to vessel
vessel.apply_forces(forces, moments)
```
